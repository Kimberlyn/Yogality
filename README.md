# Yogality
Consumer-facing virtual reality applications are currently being dominated by the video game industry. Our product, Yogality, is uniquely developed for fitness education. Yogality caters to all ages universally through intense workouts, calming yoga, or even peaceful meditation. We're interested in motivating and improving fitness and mental health with yoga in the virtual realm. By incorporating the HTC Vive VR System and Go Beyond HTC Vive Trackers to guide users into the yoga poses, users will be educated on the proper form and prevent injuries. For a comfortable experience, users can choose to meditate and workout inside a studio or outdoors in the woods. With easy, normal, and difficult levels, they can decide the type of workout session which varies in multiple poses and how long each pose may last.
